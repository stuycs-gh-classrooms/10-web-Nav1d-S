    <h1>Koch Curve</h1>
   <p>This is a basic Koch curve with the depth set to 4 and the size set to 20. </p>

   <p>This is a new rendition of the Koch Curve, it does two things. The first thing it does is alternate between the colors red and blue at random with a 50% chance of either. The second thing it does is choose the angle measure as 60 degrees, or it chooses a random angle measure between 60 and 120, with a 50% chance of each occuring. The final change had been adding to the code for the turtle to go backwards and then turn negative angles instaed of positive ones. </p>
