<h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>

<p>The RX-7 has a 30 year long history. However beofore it gained cult like status in 1993 due to it's 3rd generation, it had been a funky unsuspecting coupe. Now before we go into the RX-7, the first thing to talk about, is it's unique engine, the Wankel Engine, commonly refered to as a Rotary engine (even if that's technically wrong). The engine itself was composed of a block that was in the shape of an oval, with a rotating triangular rotor in the center. If you want you can learn more about the Rotary's history and how it in the link labeled Rotary engine. </p>

<p>The RX-7 FB (or SA22C) had been produced from 1978 to 1985 with a little under half a million units produced. It came out with a 12A two rotor engine in older genearations, and in newer ones a 13B two rotor engine. The hp varied from 100 in the older generations up to 135 in newer ones. In later turbocharged versions it had made 160hp. While this may sound like a small amount, the FB itself only weighed 2300 to 2500 thousand pounds. 0-60 times had ranged from 8-10 seconds depending on the model version with a top speed of 120 mph.</p>

  <p>The RX-7 FC (sometimes referred to as the savanna RX-7) is the second generation generation of RX-7 produced from 1985-1992. The design itself took more inspiration from the Porsche 924. This RX-7 had a little under 300000 units produced, and was optioned with a 13B engine, with a turbocharged model available. The hp would vary from 147 hp to 185 hp with turbo models, and 0-60 times would range from 7-9 seconds. The top speed had been 130 mph. Even with the increased hp the weight increase to 2700 to 2900 pounds slowed the car down. </p>

<h2>Generation 3: FD</h2>
<p>The RX-7 FD came out in 1993, with 70000 units produced. It came with a newly revised 13B-REW engine. It also had two rotors, but this time it only came with a new sequential twin turbo system. This system works by having one turbocharger push air into the engine at RPM's below 4 thousand, while the second turbocharger activates above 4 thousand all the way to 8 thousand RPM. This had allowed for power and torque at all RPM's. The hp was brought up to 255 up to 276 depending on the model year, with 217 lb ft of torque. It had only weighed 2700 to 2900 pounds, meaning it was fast, and could do extremely well in the corners. If you want to learn about the design of the RX-7 FD click the link labelled "design".</p>

  <h2>Modern Day Legacy</h2>
  <p>The RX-7 to this day remaains extremely popular, despite being overshadowed by it's competitors. The car is mainly used as a project car these days, where people would add various modifications to make more power. Engines such as the 20B with three rotors and the 26B with four rotors are used in these builds. Along with many engine swaps, also exist bodykits. These are just additional panels you can add to the body, the most famous of these kits being the VeilSide bodykit. Another famous example of a RX-7 would be Rob-Dahm's four rotor all wheel drive RX7. This car had been incredible due to how much time and effor was put into it. It took many parts from various other cars to put together. He used a four rotor single turbo engine, with power going to all four wheels. It had produced up to 2000hp in some instances. A link is provided if you wish to learn more. While the RX-7's legacy ended with the FD, Mazda had created the RX-8 as a succesor, however that car had become notorius for bad reliability due to many owners failing to do basic maintence, and the gas mileage which was horrible due to the nature of the engine. In 2012 Mazda was forced to move away from the rotary due to new emissions standards. However many people as of today keep this engine and these cars alive becuase of how fun they can be.    </p>
