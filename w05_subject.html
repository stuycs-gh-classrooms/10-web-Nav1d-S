<h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>

<p>The RX-7 has a 30 year long history. However beofore it gained cult like status in 1993 due to it's 3rd generation, it had been a funky unsuspecting coupe. Now before we go into the RX-7, the first thing to talk about, is it's unique engine, the Wankel Engine, commonly refered to as a Rotary engine (even if that's technically wrong). The engine itself was composed of a block that was in the shape of an oval, with a rotating triangular rotor in the center. If you want you can learn more about the Rotary's history and how it works here. </p>
