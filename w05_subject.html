<h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>

<p>The RX-7 has a 30 year long history. However beofore it gained cult like status in 1993 due to it's 3rd generation, it had been a funky unsuspecting coupe. Now before we go into the RX-7, the first thing to talk about, is it's unique engine, the Wankel Engine, commonly refered to as a Rotary engine (even if that's technically wrong). The engine itself was composed of a block that was in the shape of an oval, with a rotating triangular rotor in the center. If you want you can learn more about the Rotary's history and how it in the link labeled Rotary engine. </p>

<p>The RX-7 FB (or SA22C) had been produced from 1978 to 1985 with a little under half a million units produced. It came out with a 12A two rotor engine in older genearations, and in newer ones a 13B two rotor engine. The hp varied from 100 in the older generations up to 135 in newer ones. In later turbocharged versions it had made 160hp. While this may sound like a small amount, the FB itself only weighed 2300 to 2500 thousand pounds. 0-60 times had ranged from 8-10 seconds depending on the model version with a top speed of 120 mph.</p>

  <p>The RX-7 FC (sometimes referred to as the savanna RX-7) is the second generation generation of RX-7 produced from 1985-1992. The design itself took more inspiration from the Porsche 924. This RX-7 had a little under 300000 units produced, and was optioned with a 13B engine, with a turbocharged model available. The hp would vary from 147 hp to 185 hp with turbo models, and 0-60 times would range from 7-9 seconds. The top speed had been 130 mph. Even with the increased hp the weight increase to 2700 to 2900 pounds slowed the car down. </p>
