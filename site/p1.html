    <h2>Generation FB: The start</h2>

  The year had been 1978. Mazda has just created the Savanna/SA22C RX-7. It had been the succesor to the Savanna RX-3, and with it brough a new sleek and design look, compared to the much more boxy RX-3. The first generations had recieved the 12A two rotor engine. It had a displacement of 1.1 liters, which had produced 100hp, 105lb-ft of torque, and a redline of 7000 RPM. While 100hp paper sounds very little, the RX-7 had been very light, weighing in at just 2350 lbs. This pushed it to 60mph in a little under 10 seconds. Another extremely important part about the rotary was it's size. It was extremely small in comparison to the power it generated. It had been able to sit behind the front axle of the car, and had a 50/50 weight ratio, making the handling of the car superior to almost anything else on the road. The car had a step up with the series 2 of the car coming out in 1981, and being produced until 1983. It had been refered to as the FB now. The first improvemnet had been towards the transmission. The 4 speed manual it used to have was dropped for a newer 5 speed manual. The hp was also significantly improved with the introudction of a newer 12A engine in the SE-limited editions. This engine had produced 138hp, meaning at the time, it would feel like a rocket. The final series, series 3 had been the introduction to the 13B family of engines. These had been twin rotor engines with a displacement of 1.3 litres, and bumped up in power. In the GSL-SE trims, it had produced 135 hp with 133lb-ft of torque. A big step up for the series 3. This allowed for it to speed up to 60mph in 8 seconds, two seconds faster than the 12A engine. Finally there had also been a turbocharged FB. A turbocharger basically forced more air into the engine for more power to be produced. In this case the power was brough to a whopping 160 hp, at nearly the same weight. However things took a turn for the next generation, not neccesarily bad, but not as revolutionary. Nearly half a million FB's had been produced within it's production life time.

  <h2>Generation FC: The Copycat</h2>

      Starting right where the FB had left in 1985 of we got the FC/Savanna RX-7. Now the very first important thing here is how simillar, the car looked to the Porsche 944. They had basically been the same car, following a simillar philosophy. Anyways the RX-7 FC had been much more of a Grand Touring car than sports car compared to it's predecessor. It had weighed much more at 2700 lbs, which means it had gained 350 lbs from the last generation. However mainly everything else about this newer generation car. First off the handling had been improved, that allowed for less understeer, with a more sofisticated steering system. Another new feature Mazda had introduced was the Dyanamic Tracking Suspension System. This had allowed the rear wheels to somewhat turn through the suspension adjusting itself at a fast turn. The engine had been the 13B twin rotor yet again, and the hp amounts had varied from series 4 to 5 and whether or not their was a turbocharger equipped. In general the naturally aspirated FC's had less hp with series 4, which were produced from 1986-1988, having 146 hp, and the turbo ii edition having 182 hp. The series 5 produced from 1989-1992 had produced 160 hp naturally aspirated and 200 hp with a turbocharger. The redline for all these generations had been at 7000 RPM. A special GTU edition had been released in order to commemorate the 8 straight wins of the RX-7 in the IMSA GTU races. While this generation seemed a bit lackluster, the next generation makes up for everything, heavily.
