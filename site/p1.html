    <h2>Generation FB: The start</h2>

  The year had been 1978. Mazda has just created the Savanna/SA22C RX-7. It had been the succesor to the Savanna RX-3, and with it brough a new sleek and design look, compared to the much more boxy RX-3. The first generations had recieved the 12A two rotor engine. It had a displacement of 1.1 liters, which had produced 100hp, 105lb-ft of torque, and a redline of 7000 RPM. While 100hp paper sounds very little, the RX-7 had been very light, weighing in at just 2350 lbs. This pushed it to 60mph in a little under 10 seconds. Another extremely important part about the rotary was it's size. It was extremely small in comparison to the power it generated. It had been able to sit behind the front axle of the car, and had a 50/50 weight ratio, making the handling of the car superior to almost anything else on the road. The car had a step up with the series 2 of the car coming out in 1981, and being produced until 1983. It had been refered to as the FB now. The first improvemnet had been towards the transmission. The 4 speed manual it used to have was dropped for a newer 5 speed manual. The hp was also significantly improved with the introudction of a newer 12A engine in the SE-limited editions. This engine had produced 138hp, meaning at the time, it would feel like a rocket. The final series, series 3 had been the introduction to the 13B family of engines. These had been twin rotor engines with a displacement of 1.3 litres, and bumped up in power. In the GSL-SE trims, it had produced 135 hp with 133lb-ft of torque. A big step up for the series 3. This allowed for it to speed up to 60mph in 8 seconds, two seconds faster than the 12A engine. Finally there had also been a turbocharged FB. A turbocharger basically forced more air into the engine, by using exhaust gases to first spool up, and then be able to suck in more air for more power to be produced. In this case the power was brough to a whopping 160 hp, at nearly the same weight. However things took a turn for the next generation, not neccesarily bad, but not as revolutionary. Nearly half a million FB's had been produced within it's production life time.

  <h2>Generation FC: The Copycat</h2>

      Starting right where the FB had left in 1985 of we got the FC/Savanna RX-7. Now the very first important thing here is how simillar, the car looked to the Porsche 944. They had basically been the same car, following a simillar philosophy. On the left is an FC while on the right is a 944, just so you can see the similarity. Anyways the RX-7 FC had been much more of a Grand Touring car than sports car compared to it's predecessor. It had weighed much more at 2700 lbs with the weight going up to 3000 lbs in turbo versions, which means it had gained 350 lbs from the last generation. However mainly everything else about this newer generation car. First off the handling had been improved, that allowed for less understeer, with a more sofisticated steering system. Another new feature Mazda had introduced was the Dyanamic Tracking Suspension System. This had allowed the rear wheels to somewhat turn through the suspension adjusting itself at a fast turn. The engine had been the 13B twin rotor yet again, and the hp amounts had varied from series 4 to 5 and whether or not their was a turbocharger equipped. In general the naturally aspirated FC's had less hp with series 4, which were produced from 1986-1988, having 146 hp, and the turbo ii edition having 182 hp. The series 5 produced from 1989-1992 had produced 160 hp naturally aspirated and 200 hp with a turbocharger. The redline for all these generations had been at 7000 RPM. A special GTU edition had been released in order to commemorate the 8 straight wins of the RX-7 in the IMSA GTU races. While this generation seemed a bit lackluster, the next generation makes up for everything, heavily.

  <h2>Generation FD: The Magnum Opus</h2>

The 3rd generation of RX-7, also known as the FD, had first went into production in 1993, with all production of it stopping in 2002. The first incredible thing about the FD is it's design. This design was all inspired by Mazda, not taken by any other brand like the last generation. The FD also lost weight, only weighing 2800 lbs with two turbochargers. The FD had came with the new 13B-REW engine. This 13B had used new sequential turbochargers. The way this system would work is while the engine was at 1000-4000 RPM one turbocharger would push air into the engine, and at 4500 RPM a second turbocharger would also start pushing air into the engine. However before the second turbocharger is able to activate, there is a dip in pressure, which causes a semi-smooth experience in controlling the RPM. This allowed the FD to have a 0-60 of 5 seconds, and a top speed of around 160-165 mph. A 5 speed manual is what came with the FD. Mazda's subrand ɛ̃fini also had their own rebaged RX-7 FD. The hp had varied from 252 to 276 hp depending on the year, as in later years small tweaks allowed for a little more horsepower. Another great aspect of the FD was the placement of the engine being behind the front axle, and due to the weight of the 13B, the car had a 50/50 weight distribution. This allowed for superb handling compared to anything else that was out at the time. It had also been one of the main selling points of this car. It's competition had been extremely heavy, acting more like Grand Touring cars, rather than a sports car. The most desirable model was produced in the final year of the FD's production. This car was the RX-7 FD Spirit R. There had been a type A, B, and C. The type A and B had been simillar with the type B having two back seats, and the type C had a 4 speed automatic transmission. The type A is said to be the best.
