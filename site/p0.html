    <h1>The Beginnings</h1>
    <p>
      It was the 1960's, and many companies had picked up the rotary engine. This included brands like NSU (old german car company that was inhaled by Volkswagon), General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Porsche, Rolls-Royce, Suzuki, Toyota, and Ford. However all of these companies had soon ditched the idea of a rotary engine. At the time it just wasn't feasable due to not enough research being poured into this engine. One small company, Mazda, had decided to take up the challenge and saw a future where this enginge would reign supreme. The reasarch and development for the rotary engine had began, and it was very rough for a long while. The main issue with this engine, is when the reauleuax trianlge rotated it had left behind scratch marks on the housing.
