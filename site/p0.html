    <h1>The Beginnings</h1>

    <h2>Rotary Engine Revolution</h2>

      It was the 1960's, and many companies had picked up the rotary engine. This included brands like NSU (old german car company that was inhaled by Volkswagon), General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Porsche, Rolls-Royce, Suzuki, Toyota, and Ford. However all of these companies had soon ditched the idea of a rotary engine. At the time it just wasn't feasable due to not enough research being poured into this engine. One small company, Mazda, had decided to take up the challenge and saw a future where this enginge would reign supreme. The reasarch and development for the rotary engine had began, and it was very rough for a long while. The main issue with this engine, is when the reauleuax trianlge rotated it had left behind scratch marks on the housing, due to the Apex Seals on the three points. In 1963 the engineers at Mazda had created a new type of seal for the engine, made of aluminum-carbon composite material, and more hollow. This led to the creation of the 0810 and 0813 rotary engines, with the 0813 coming out later. This engine would go into the car that would start all of this, the Mazda Cosmo Sport.

    <h2>Cosmo: It do be flying</h2>

      The Mazda Cosmo was among Mazda's first purely rotary powered cars. The other cars Mazda produced could be optioned with a rotary, but this car, you had to get the rotary. The first series of Cosmo's had featured a 1.0 liter, two rotor engine that had produced 110 hp. The engine had a redline of 7000 RPM, back then this was incredible. It had a quarter mile of 16.4 second and a top speed of 115 mph, with a 4 speed manual transmission. It came equipped with a anti-roll bar for more stability in high speed cornering, and double wishbone suspension.. The series two had recieved a few upgrades with the new 0813 engine. It produced 128 hp and now had a 5 speed manual. It had an improved quarter mile of 15.8 seconds with a new top speed of 120 mph.

      Now the sad thing about the cosmo is that we didn't really get the most incredible cars. The next few generations were the start of the RX line up. However some of these had not been offered only with the rotary, which was kinda the main point. The cooler of all these succesors had been the Eunos Cosmo in my opinion (an image is shown above). Eunos had been a luxury subdivision of Mazda from 1989-1996. This Cosmo had been in production from 1990-1996. It had the option of a 13B-RE turbo, two rotors with a turbocharger (ill explain more on this engine in the next section), and the more famous option, a 20B-REW turbo engine, paired to a 4 speed automatic transmission. The 20B-REW engine had been a three rotor engine, the only one mazda would use in a production car. It had come with 276 hp, have a top speed of 158 mph. Performance still wasn't the main focus of this car, it had been luxury. Performance had been the job of the seven's generation. Three of Mazda's most incredible cars I will talk about in the next section.
