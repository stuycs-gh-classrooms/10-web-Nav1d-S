      This website serves to retell the Mazda wankel engine, more commonly refered to as the rotary. The very first rotary engine produced had been by german scientist Felix Wankel in the 1950's, however he is a very bad engineer and all his models sucked, (he also sucked). Mazda had then bought the licesning from NSU, a German car company, and had soon began resarch and devlopment into crafting the rotary engine into a masterpiece.
