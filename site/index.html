      This website serves to retell the Mazda wankel engine, more commonly refered to as the rotary. The very first rotary engine produced had been by german scientist Felix Wankel in the 1950's. Mazda had then bought the licesning from NSU, a German car company, and had soon began resarch and devlopment into crafting the rotary engine into a masterpiece, creating the Cosmo sport, the big bang of it all. The most refined versions of the rotary came from the RX-7's, three generations of cars that had fully abused the capabilities of the rotary engine, and were some of Mazda's greatest masterpieces. Other than that the rotary was also known for it's tuning potential, such as Rob Dahm's RX-7.
