<h1>Legacy of the rotary</h1>

    <h2>Le mans</h2>

  The Mazda rotary has a rich history with motorsport. The most notable event Mazda had won was the 24 heur of le mans. This is a 24 hour race that takes place in France at the Circut de la Sarthe. The year had been 1991, and it had been Mazda's last shot to use a rotary in the 24 heures of le mans becuase of the FIA wanting piston engines only. Mazda had been devloping the 787B based on the 767B, its predecesor. It had used an engine names the R26B. A 4 rotor engine with a displacement of 2.6 litres. It had the ability to produce up to 900hp, however for the race the car had been limited to 700hp to increase the reliability. This had been proven neccessary as during the race the 787B had been able to overtake the Mercedes C11 due to a spinning off and having a gearbox problem. The 787B had been able to take first place due to the C11 infront of it also having mechanical problems. Jhonny Herbert who was the driver of the 787B had been so dehydrated that he needed to be pulled out, and taken to the medical center. After the race, Mazda's team had taken apart the engine to analyze the wear and tear that had happended from the race. They had determined that the engine would be able to run another 24 hours of this race.

<h2>Rob Dahm</h2>

    <p>
      Another aspect of the Mazda rotary is the tuning culture behind it. A majority of RX-7 owners in this world have some form of modificaition done to their RX-7. The most famous tuned RX-7 in my opinion would be Rob Dahm's AWD 4 rotor RX-7. This RX-7 is a true marvel of engineering just based on the amount of trial and error that went into it. The first incredible aspect of this would be the custom built 4 rotor engine, which had been capable of handling 30-40 psi. For context a normal RX-7 FD would only handle 10 psi out of factory. This allows Dahm's RX-7 to have 1000+ hp. The second incredible thing about his car would be how he converted the car to All Wheel Drive (AWD). He had taken the transmission of a Nissan GTR, and completly swapped it out. This allows the car to be very good for drag racing and allows for the power to be adequatley put down. The final cool part about this that I feel really represents the legacy of the RX-7 is the new bodywork on the car. Making it slightly wider, but also paying homage to the original curves of the RX-7, helps to solidify this car as nothign short of legendary. As of now the car is currently going through another engine rebuild, due to a blown rotor from the engines computer accidently putting too much pressure on the enigne.
