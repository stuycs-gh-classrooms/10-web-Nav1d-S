  The Mazda rotary has a rich history with motorsport. The most notable event Mazda had won was the 24 heur of le mans. This is a 24 hour race that takes place in France at the Circut de la Sarthe. The year had been 1991, and it had been Mazda's last shot to use a rotary in the 24 heures of le mans becuase of the FIA wanting piston engines only. Mazda had been devloping the 787B based on the 767B, its predecesor. It had used an engine names the R26B. A 4 rotor engine with a displacement of 2.6 litres. It had the ability to produce up to 900hp, however for the race the car had been limited to 700hp to increase the reliability. This had been proven neccessary as during the race the 787B had been able to overtake the Mercedes C11 due to a spinning off and having a gearbox problem. The 787B had been able to take first place due to the C11 infront of it also having mechanical problems. Jhonny Herbert who was the driver of the 787B had been so dehydrated that he needed to be pulled out, and taken to the medical center. After the race, Mazda's team had taken apart the engine to analyze the wear and tear that had happended from the race. They had determined that the engine would be able to run another 24 hours of this race.
