<p>
  The Mazda rotary has a rich history with motorsport. The most notable event Mazda had won was the 24 heur of le mans. This is a 24 hour race that takes place in France at the Circut de la Sarthe. The year had been 1991, and it had been Mazda's last shot to use a rotary in the 24 heures of le mans becuase of the FIA wanting piston engines only.
